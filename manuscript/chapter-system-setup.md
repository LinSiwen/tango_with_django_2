#Setting up your System {#chapter-system-setup}
This supplementary chapter provides additional setup guides that complement the [initial setup chapter](#chapter-getting-ready). We provide setup guides for installing and configuring the various technologies that you will be using within Tango with Django. Refer to the section that is relevant to you; you do not need to work through all of this chapter if things are already working for you.

I> ## Common Guides
I>
I> This chapter provides instructions on how to set up the various technologies that you'll be using throughout Tango with Django that we believe will work on the largest number of systems. However, every computer setup is different -- different versions of software, different operating systems, etc. These differences make providing universal setup guides very difficult to do.
I> 
I> If you are using this book as part of a course, you may be provided with setup instructions unique to your lab computers. Follow these instructions instead -- a majority of the setup work will likely be taken care of for you already.
I>
I> However, if you are working solo and you follow the instructions provided in this chapter without success, we recommend heading to your favourite search engine and entering the problem you're having. Typically, this will involve copying and pasting the error message you see at whatever step you're struggling at. By pasting in the message verbatim, chances are you'll find someone who suffered the same issue as you -- and from that point, you'll hopefully find a solution to resolve your problem.
